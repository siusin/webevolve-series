           <h2>Summary </h2>
          <p>Beihang University, as the W3C partner in China, hosted a seminar on "Digital Identity: Technologies, Standards, and Policies" in Beijing on August 13th. The seminar gathered over 40 representatives from research institutions, standardization organizations, industrial vendors, and users related to digital identity. Through six presentations and then open discussions, attendees explored standards and practices related to digital identity.</p>
        <p>Philippe Le Hegaret (W3C Strategy and Project Lead) delivered a presentation entitled "<strong>W3C Digital Identity Standards Strategy</strong>" (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2024/Talks/identity-plh/">slides</a>), which introduced the collection of use cases for W3C identity and credential-related standards, identity management processes and models, applications of federated identity standards such as the <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/">Federated Credential Management API</a> and <a href="https://fedidcg.github.io/FedCM/#browser-api-login-status">Login Status API</a> to replace some third-party cookies, the support of distributed identity through the <a href="https://wicg.github.io/digital-identities/">Digital Credentials API</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/w3c-cg/threat-modeling/blob/main/models/decentralized-identities.md">an analysis of the distributed identity threat model</a>. Philippe also shared the latest developments in the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/">Decentralized Identifiers (DID)</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-overview/">Verifiable Credentials (VC)</a> standards, primarily covering standards for the VC data model and data integrity verification.</p>

        <p>Shan FU (China Academy of Information and Communications Technology) gave a talk titled "<strong>Application and standardization of Distributed Identity for mobile intelligent terminals</strong>". She analyzed the characteristics of distributed digital identity, such as autonomous control, portability, and minimization of personal information collection. She introduced the application of distributed digital identity in various scenarios, including securities trading, credit loans, and identity verification, emphasizing features like privacy protection and secure control. Fu noted that mobile intelligent terminals have become an important carrier for the application of distributed digital identity, with distributed digital identity credentials deployed on user terminal devices in the form of applications or digital wallets. The integration of distributed digital identity wallets into terminals significantly enhances user experience, and she provided detailed information about the national standards, industry standards, and organizational standards related to distributed digital identity on mobile intelligent terminals.</p>

        <p>Di LI (ANICERT, Frist Research Institute of Ministry of Public Security) gave a presentation titled "<strong>Cross-institutional collaborative data flow applications and rights protection based on trusted digital identities</strong>". The main content included the current status and trends of digital identity development in China, how digital identity promotes data flow and sharing, identity rights service design, and related case studies. He discussed a practical implementation plan for key technologies of trusted distributed digital identity services, which involves extending personal distributed identity identifiers (DID) based on residents' legal identities. This includes issuing publicly verifiable Verifiable Credentials (VC) by institutions and presenting attribute claims (VP) with personal authorization. The plan relies on blockchain to disclose personal DIDs and public keys, as well as institutional DIDs and public keys, to achieve distributed authentication, along with several application cases based on this technology.</p>

        <p>Keke GAI (Beijing Institute of Technology) presentend "<strong>Principle and application exploration of distributed digital identity technology</strong>". In his presentation, he conducted a detailed analysis and discussion of distributed digital identity technology from multiple aspects, including definitions, development history, and technical architecture. Professor Ge mentioned the challenges and issues faced by distributed digital identity technology in practice, such as difficulties in identity verification and privacy protection, and deficiencies in technical standards and application scenarios. He particularly emphasized the challenges and importance of privacy protection, proposing solutions and technologies to resist data mining attacks, privacy protection threat models, anonymous databases, and covert communication. The report focused on issues related to blockchain-based distributed digital identity and privacy protection, discussing efficient and scalable methods and applications.</p>

        <p>Yifan HE (BSN, Red Date Technology) presented "<strong>IIFAA Distributed trusted certification helps to implement the Marrakesh Treaty in China</strong>". In his report, he introduced the BSN real-name DID service, which was jointly established by the BSN Development Alliance and the First Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security based on a Trusted Identity Authentication Platform (CTID) and BSN. This service can generate distributed digital identities with real-name attributes that are traceable. The report outlined specific application cases of the BSN real-name DID service across various fields, highlighting its main features: first, it brings about a transformation in the methods of registration and login, allowing users to no longer use privacy-exposing account passwords and mobile verification codes. Instead, they can use real-name DIDs and private key signatures. Second, it enhances data rights, including data ownership clarification and the separation of ownership and usage rights. Third, it provides individuals with more encrypted means to protect their privacy data.</p>
        
        <p>Wu ZHANG (Alipay) presented "<strong>IIFAA Distributed trusted certification helps to implement the Marrakesh Treaty in China</strong>". He introduced the main contents of the distributed trusted authentication technical specifications released by the IIFAA Alliance, elaborating on the concept of distributed trusted authentication and how to build a user-centered cross-institutional authentication system to address privacy and trust issues. He emphasized how to leverage distributed trusted authentication technology to assist various types of disabled individuals in enjoying the benefits of the digital economy through identity digital anonymization, while also reducing the access costs for public welfare organizations, enabling them to quickly connect and provide various public services to disabled populations. This aims to continuously strengthen the protection of the rights and interests of disabled individuals and promote the equalization of social public service resources, contributing to the construction of a harmonious and beautiful society.</p>

        <h3>After thorough and in-depth discussions during the meeting, the feedback and suggestions from the attendees are summarized as follows:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Standards for the Next Generation Digital Identity</strong>: New standards related to digital identity should promote greater trust, security, and protection of user privacy, while enhancing users' control over their digital identity data. Currently, the technical roadmap of W3C's digital identity-related standards aligns with this development direction. It is suggested to effectively utilize W3C’s organizational platform to export domestic advanced technical standards and industrial practices related to digital identity. Beihang University will timely announce the progress of W3C's relevant standards in the field of digital identity and welcomes domestic industry peers to participate in the formulation of W3C-related standards and provide valuable opinions and suggestions.</li>
          <li><strong>Standardization of Terminology</strong>: Efforts should be made to strengthen the normative usage and translation of various digital identity-related standards in terms of core concepts and terminology, such as Authentication, Credentials, Identity, Identification, Identifier, and Verification, in accordance with relevant national standards such as GB/T 25069-2022 “Information Security Technology Terminology.”</li>
          <li><strong>Cross-Border Interoperability</strong>: It is recommended to actively explore how digital identity can achieve interoperability and mutual recognition through standardized solutions in cross-border circulation scenarios, such as how digital passports and digital boarding passes based on China’s CTID system can be verified with institutions in other countries in parallel scenarios.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Effectiveness of Standards</strong>: Further solutions should be sought regarding the legal effectiveness of the implementation of digital identity-related standard technologies, and relevant guiding documents should be issued. For instance, it should be determined whether the use of DID complies with requirements of digital signature laws and other related legal regulations, and how to reflect its legal effectiveness when using DID. It is also recommended to clarify the rights, responsibilities, and benefits in the practical application of digital identities through standardization, such as stipulating the responsibilities of all parties involved with DID. Additionally, further exploration of incentive mechanisms for using open standard technologies like DID is suggested; for example, a fair and reasonable fee system should be developed to support the long-term healthy operation of the DID network, especially when there is a separation between identity issuers and verifiers.</li>
          <li><strong>Balancing Public Disclosure and Privacy</strong>: It is recommended to further explore reasonable intermediate solutions between the openness of the relationship binding DID to real-name subjects and anonymity, so that the convenience of DID’s public accessibility can be maintained while also protecting the privacy and data security of DID users.</li>
